       "[Document(page_content=\"Every playground run is logged in the system and can be used to create test cases or compare with other runs.Beta Testing\\u200bBeta testing allows developers to collect more data on how their LLM applications are performing in real-world scenarios. In this phase, it’s important to develop an understanding for the types of inputs the app is performing well or poorly on and how exactly it’s breaking down in those cases. Both feedback collection and run annotation are critical for this workflow. This will help in curation of test cases that can help track regressions/improvements and development of automatic evaluations.Capturing Feedback\\u200bWhen launching your application to an initial set of users, it’s important to gather human feedback on the responses it’s producing. This helps draw attention to the most interesting runs and highlight edge cases that are causing problematic responses. LangSmith allows you to attach feedback scores to logged traces (oftentimes, this is hooked up to a feedback button in your app), then filter on traces that have a specific feedback tag and score. A common workflow is to filter on traces that receive a poor user feedback score, then drill down into problematic points using the detailed trace view.Annotating Traces\\u200bLangSmith also supports sending runs to annotation queues, which allow annotators to closely inspect interesting traces and annotate them with respect to different criteria. Annotators can be PMs, engineers, or even subject matter experts. This allows users to catch regressions across important evaluation criteria.Adding Runs to a Dataset\\u200bAs your application progresses through the beta testing phase, it's essential to continue collecting data to refine and improve its performance. LangSmith enables you to add runs as examples to datasets (from both the project page and within an annotation queue), expanding your test coverage on real-world scenarios. This is a key benefit in having your logging system and your evaluation/testing system in the same platform.Production\\u200bClosely inspecting key data points, growing benchmarking datasets, annotating traces, and drilling down into important data in trace view are workflows you’ll also want to do once your app hits production.However, especially at the production stage, it’s crucial to get a high-level overview of application performance with respect to latency, cost, and feedback scores. This ensures that it's delivering desirable results at scale.Online evaluations and automations allow you to process and score production traces in near real-time.Additionally, threads provide a seamless way to group traces from a single conversation, making it easier to track the performance of your application across multiple turns.Monitoring and A/B Testing\\u200bLangSmith provides monitoring charts that allow you to track key metrics over time. You can expand to view metrics for a given period and drill down into a specific data point to get a trace table for that time period — this is especially handy for debugging production issues.LangSmith also allows for tag and metadata grouping, which allows users to mark different versions of their applications with different identifiers and view how they are performing side-by-side within each chart. This is helpful for A/B testing changes in prompt, model, or retrieval strategy.Automations\\u200bAutomations are a powerful feature in LangSmith that allow you to perform actions on traces in near real-time. This can be used to automatically score traces, send them to annotation queues, or send them to datasets.To define an automation, simply provide a filter condition, a sampling rate, and an action to perform. Automations are particularly helpful for processing traces at production scale.Threads\\u200bMany LLM applications are multi-turn, meaning that they involve a series of interactions between the user and the application.

However, when things go wrong (an unexpected end result, infinite agent loop, slower than expected execution, higher than expected token usage), it’s extremely helpful to debug by looking through the application traces. LangSmith gives clear visibility and debugging information at each step of an LLM sequence, making it much easier to identify and root-cause issues.\\nWe provide native rendering of chat messages, functions, and retrieve documents.Initial Test Set\\u200bWhile many developers still ship an initial version of their application based on “vibe checks”, we’ve seen an increasing number of engineering teams start to adopt a more test driven approach. LangSmith allows developers to create datasets, which are collections of inputs and reference outputs, and use these to run tests on their LLM applications.\\nThese test cases can be uploaded in bulk, created on the fly, or exported from application traces. LangSmith also makes it easy to run custom evaluations (both LLM and heuristic based) to score test results.Comparison View\\u200bWhen prototyping different versions of your applications and making changes, it’s important to see whether or not you’ve regressed with respect to your initial test cases.\\nOftentimes, changes in the prompt, retrieval strategy, or model choice can have huge implications in responses produced by your application.\\nIn order to get a sense for which variant is performing better, it’s useful to be able to view results for different configurations on the same datapoints side-by-side. We’ve invested heavily in a user-friendly comparison view for test runs to track and diagnose regressions in test scores across multiple revisions of your application.Playground\\u200bLangSmith provides a playground environment for rapid iteration and experimentation.\\nThis allows you to quickly test out different prompts and models.

In this guide, we’ll highlight the breadth of workflows LangSmith supports and how they fit into each stage of the application development lifecycle. We hope this will inform users how to best utilize this powerful platform or give them something to consider if they’re just starting their journey.Prototyping\\u200bPrototyping LLM applications often involves quick experimentation between prompts, model types, retrieval strategy and other parameters.\\nThe ability to rapidly understand how the model is performing — and debug where it is failing — is incredibly important for this phase.Debugging\\u200bWhen developing new LLM applications, we suggest having LangSmith tracing enabled by default.\\nOftentimes, it isn’t necessary to look at every single trace. However, when things go wrong (an unexpected end result, infinite agent loop, slower than expected execution, higher than expected token usage), it’s extremely helpful to debug by looking through the application traces. LangSmith gives clear visibility and debugging information at each step of an LLM sequence, making it much easier to identify and root-cause issues.\\nWe provide native rendering of chat messages, functions, and retrieve documents.Initial Test Set\\u200bWhile many developers still ship an initial version of their application based on “vibe checks”, we’ve seen an increasing number of engineering teams start to adopt a more test driven approach. LangSmith allows developers to create datasets, which are collections of inputs and reference outputs, and use these to run tests on their LLM applications.\\nThese test cases can be uploaded in bulk, created on the fly, or exported from application traces. LangSmith also makes it easy to run custom evaluations (both LLM and heuristic based) to score test results.Comparison View\\u200bWhen prototyping different versions of your applications and making changes, it’s important to see whether or not you’ve regressed with respect to your initial test cases.\\nOftentimes, changes in the prompt, retrieval strategy, or model choice can have huge implications in responses produced by your application.\\nIn order to get a sense for which variant is performing better, it’s useful to be able to view results for different configurations on the same datapoints side-by-side. We’ve invested heavily in a user-friendly comparison view for test runs to track and diagnose regressions in test scores across multiple revisions of your application.Playground\\u200bLangSmith provides a playground environment for rapid iteration and experimentation.\\nThis allows you to quickly test out different prompts and models. You can open the playground from any prompt or model run in your trace.', metadata={'source': 'https://docs.smith.langchain.com/user_guide', 'title': 'LangSmith User Guide | 🦜️🛠️ LangSmith', 'description': 'LangSmith is a platform for LLM application development, monitoring, and testing.

       "  Document(page_content=\"Every playground run is logged in the system and can be used to create test cases or compare with other runs.Beta Testing\\u200bBeta testing allows developers to collect more data on how their LLM applications are performing in real-world scenarios. In this phase, it’s important to develop an understanding for the types of inputs the app is performing well or poorly on and how exactly it’s breaking down in those cases. Both feedback collection and run annotation are critical for this workflow. This will help in curation of test cases that can help track regressions/improvements and development of automatic evaluations.Capturing Feedback\\u200bWhen launching your application to an initial set of users, it’s important to gather human feedback on the responses it’s producing. This helps draw attention to the most interesting runs and highlight edge cases that are causing problematic responses. LangSmith allows you to attach feedback scores to logged traces (oftentimes, this is hooked up to a feedback button in your app), then filter on traces that have a specific feedback tag and score. A common workflow is to filter on traces that receive a poor user feedback score, then drill down into problematic points using the detailed trace view.Annotating Traces\\u200bLangSmith also supports sending runs to annotation queues, which allow annotators to closely inspect interesting traces and annotate them with respect to different criteria. Annotators can be PMs, engineers, or even subject matter experts. This allows users to catch regressions across important evaluation criteria.Adding Runs to a Dataset\\u200bAs your application progresses through the beta testing phase, it's essential to continue collecting data to refine and improve its performance. LangSmith enables you to add runs as examples to datasets (from both the project page and within an annotation queue), expanding your test coverage on real-world scenarios. This is a key benefit in having your logging system and your evaluation/testing system in the same platform.Production\\u200bClosely inspecting key data points, growing benchmarking datasets, annotating traces, and drilling down into important data in trace view are workflows you’ll also want to do once your app hits production.However, especially at the production stage, it’s crucial to get a high-level overview of application performance with respect to latency, cost, and feedback scores. This ensures that it's delivering desirable results at scale.Online evaluations and automations allow you to process and score production traces in near real-time.Additionally, threads provide a seamless way to group traces from a single conversation, making it easier to track the performance of your application across multiple turns.Monitoring and A/B Testing\\u200bLangSmith provides monitoring charts that allow you to track key metrics over time. You can expand to view metrics for a given period and drill down into a specific data point to get a trace table for that time period — this is especially handy for debugging production issues.LangSmith also allows for tag and metadata grouping, which allows users to mark different versions of their applications with different identifiers and view how they are performing side-by-side within each chart. This is helpful for A/B testing changes in prompt, model, or retrieval strategy.Automations\\u200bAutomations are a powerful feature in LangSmith that allow you to perform actions on traces in near real-time. This can be used to automatically score traces, send them to annotation queues, or send them to datasets.To define an automation, simply provide a filter condition, a sampling rate, and an action to perform. Automations are particularly helpful for processing traces at production scale.Threads\\u200bMany LLM applications are multi-turn, meaning that they involve a series of interactions between the user and the application.

The Author(s), under exclusive licence to Springer Science+Business Media, LLC, part of Springer Nature.\\nSummary::\\n['KD', 'KD']\\nMetastasis poses a significant challenge in combating tumors. Even in papillary thyroid cancer (PTC), which typically exhibits a favorable prognosis, high recurrence rates are attributed to metastasis. Cytoplasmic linker protein 170 (CLIP170) functions as a classical microtubule plus-end tracking protein (+TIP) and has shown close association with cell migration. Nevertheless, the specific impact of CLIP170 on PTC cells remains to be elucidated. Our analysis of the GEO and TCGA databases unveiled an association between CLIP170 and the progression of PTC. To explore the impact of CLIP170 on PTC cells, we conducted various assays. We evaluated its effects through CCK-8, wound healing assay, and transwell assay after knocking down CLIP170. Additionally, the influence of CLIP170 on the cellular actin structure was examined via immunofluorescence; we further investigated the molecular expressions of epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) and the transforming growth factor-β (TGF-β) signaling pathways through Western blotting and RT-qPCR. These findings were substantiated through an in vivo nude mouse model of lung metastasis. We observed a decreased expression of CLIP170 in PTC in contrast to normal thyroid tissue. Functionally, the knockdown of CLIP170 (CLIP170) notably enhanced the metastatic potential and EMT of PTC cells, both in vitro and in vivo. Mechanistically, CLIP170 triggered the activation of the TGF-β pathway, subsequently promoting tumor cell migration, invasion, and EMT. Remarkably, the TGF-β inhibitor LY2157299 effectively countered TGF-β activity and significantly reversed tumor metastasis and EMT induced by CLIP170 knockdown. In summary, these findings collectively propose C\""

We used representative chatbots currently available (ChatGPT-3.5, Bing Chat, and Google Bard) to answer questions commonly asked by brain tumor patients. The simulated situations with questions were made and selected by the brain tumor committee. These questions are commonly asked by brain tumor patients. The goal of the study was introduced to each chatbot, the situation was explained, and questions were asked. All responses were collected without modification. The answers were shown to the committee members, and they were asked to judge the responses while blinded to the type of chatbot. There was no significant difference in accuracy and communication ability among the three groups (p=0.253, 0.090, respectively). For empathy, Bing Chat and Google Bard were superior to ChatGPT (p=0.004, 0.002, respectively). The purpose of this study was not to assess or verify the relative superiority of each chatbot. Instead, the aim was to identify the shortcomings and changes needed if AI chatbots are to be used for patient medical purposes.

The study explores how SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect menstrual cycles, assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatments, obstetric problems during pregnancy, and the psychological effects of family planning choices during the pandemic. New evidence suggests that SARS-CoV-2 may interfere with hormone synthesis and endometrial reactions, potentially impacting menstrual blood loss. ART results have not shown significant changes, but there is limited research on embryo quality. Obstetric problems are more likely when SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester. The COVID-19 vaccine has minimal impact on menstrual cycles. Additionally, recent advancements in ACE2-related studies in pulmonary diseases are discussed, highlighting its potential role as a biomarker for early diagnosis and monitoring of these conditions. Furthermore, research on nanobodies as a therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2 variants, including omicron BA.4/BA.5, is presented, emphasizing their versatility in combating rapidly evolving infectious diseases.',\n",
       " 'source_documents': [Document(page_content=\"Concerns about the SARS-CoV-2 pandemic's possible impact on sexual and reproductive health have grown significantly. In this narrative review, the latest research on the effects of SARS-CoV-2 infection on several facets of sexual and reproductive health is reviewed. The review starts initially by going through the\\xa0possible consequences of SARS-CoV-2 on female menstrual cycles. The virus may interfere with the menstrual cycle, which could affect hormone synthesis and endometrial reactions, according to newly available evidence. Menstrual blood loss may be impacted by COVID-19's potential to influence endothelial cell function and systemic hemostasis. Hypothalamic amenorrhea may be brought on by severe COVID-19 disease. There is little research on this subject, although most women resume their regular menstrual cycles after 1-2 months of recuperation. The review also examines how SARS-CoV-2 infection may affect assisted reproductive technology (ART) treatments. There are few clinical data, although some research points to potential effects on embryo quality. Overall, ART results, however, did not materially change from the time before the epidemic. Obstetric problems are more likely when SARS-CoV-2 infection occurs during pregnancy, especially in the third trimester. Even though the maternal death rate is still low, pregnant women, especially those with comorbidities, are more likely to experience serious sickness. The review emphasizes how the COVID-19 vaccine affects menstrual cycles, showing brief, modest modifications without serious health hazards. Also included are the psychological effects of family planning choices during the pandemic. In conclusion, this narrative review offers a thorough assessment of the complicated and changing effects of SARS-CoV-2 on sexual and reproductive health. The different requirements of people and couples during and after the pandemic are highlighted, underscoring the necessity for ongoing study and specialized healthcare practices.\", metadata={'uid': '38738039', 'Title': 'The Multi-faceted Effects of COVID-19 on Female Reproductive Health: An Updated Narrative Review.', 'Published': '2024-04-09', 'Copyright Information': 'Copyright © 2024, Al-Bdairi et al.'}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content='Angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) is an important regulator of the Renin-Angiotensin System (RAS). Additionally, it has been identified as a functional receptor for the Coronavirus. Research indicates that ACE2 plays a role in the regulation of cardiovascular systems by modulating blood pressure and electrolyte balance. Its role in pulmonary diseases has also garnered significant attention due to the widespread prevalence of Coronavirus. There is solid evidence linking ACE2 to other pulmonary diseases, including chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, acute respiratory distress syndrome, allergic asthma, among others. However, the exact pathological and physiological mechanisms of ACE2 in these diseases remain elusive. Our research aims to review and explore the latest advancements in ACE2-related studies in pulmonary diseases. These findings have the potential to open new avenues for utilizing ACE2 as a potential biomarker for early diagnosis and monitoring of pulmonary diseases.', metadata={'uid': '38736435', 'Title': 'Association Between ACE2 and Lung Diseases.', 'Published': '2024-05-07', 'Copyright Information': '© 2024 Su et al.'}),\n",
       "  Document(page_content='To date, all major modes of monoclonal antibody therapy targeting SARS-CoV-2 have lost significant efficacy against the latest circulating variants. As SARS-CoV-2 omicron sublineages account for over 90% of COVID-19 infections, evasion of immune responses generated by vaccination or exposure to previous variants poses a significant challenge. A compelling new therapeutic strategy against SARS-CoV-2 is that of single-domain antibodies, termed nanobodies, which address certain limitations of monoclonal antibodies. Here, we demonstrate that our high-affinity nanobody repertoire, generated against wild-type SARS-CoV-2 spike protein (Mast et al., 2021), remains effective against variants of concern, including omicron BA.4/BA.5; a subset is predicted to counter resistance in emerging XBB and BQ.1.1 sublineages. Furthermore, we reveal the synergistic potential of nanobody cocktails in neutralizing emerging variants. Our study highlights the power of nanobody technology as a versatile therapeutic and diagnostic tool to combat rapidly evolving infectious diseases such as SARS-CoV-2.', metadata={'uid': '38712823', 'Title': 'Nanobody repertoire generated against the spike protein of ancestral SARS-CoV-2 remains efficacious against the rapidly evolving virus.', 'Published': '2024-05-07', 'Copyright Information': '© 2023, Ketaren, Mast, Fridy et al.'})]}"
