       "[Document(page_content=\"BACKGROUND: In 2021, the United States experienced a 14% rise in fatal drug overdoses totaling 106,699 deaths, driven by harmful opioid use, particularly among individuals in the perinatal period who face increased risks associated with opioid use disorders (OUDs). Increased concerns about the impacts of escalating harmful opioid use among pregnant and postpartum persons are rising. Most of the current limited perinatal OUD studies were conducted using traditional methods, such as interviews and randomized controlled trials to understand OUD treatment, risk factors, and associated adverse effects. However, little is known about how social media data, such as X, formerly known as Twitter, can be leveraged to explore and identify broad perinatal OUD trends, disclosure and communication patterns, and public health surveillance about OUD in the perinatal period.\\nOBJECTIVE: The objective is 3-fold: first, we aim to identify key themes and trends in perinatal OUD discussions on platform X. Second, we explore user engagement patterns, including replying and retweeting behaviors. Third, we investigate computational methods that could potentially streamline and scale the labor-intensive manual annotation effort.\\nMETHODS: We extracted 6 million raw perinatal-themed tweets posted by global X users during the opioid epidemic from May 2019 to October 2021. After data cleaning and sampling, we used 500 tweets related to OUD in the perinatal period by US X users for a thematic analysis using NVivo (Lumivero) software.\\nRESULTS: Seven major themes emerged from our thematic analysis: (1) political views related to harmful opioid and other substance use, (2) perceptions of others' substance use, (3) lived experiences of opioid and other substance use, (4) news reports or papers related to opioid and other substance use, (5) health care initiatives, (6) adverse effects on children's health due to parental substance use, and (7) topics related to nonopioid substance use. Among these 7 themes, our user engagement analysis revealed that themes 4 and 5 received the highest average retweet counts, and theme 3 received the highest average tweet reply count. We further found that different computational methods excel in analyzing different themes.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Social media platforms such as X can serve as a valuable tool for analyzing real-time discourse and exploring public perceptions, opinions, and behaviors related to maternal substance use, particularly, harmful opioid use in the perinatal period. More health promotion strategies can be carried out on social media platforms to provide educational support for the OUD perinatal population.\", metadata={'uid': '39374068', 'Title': 'Disclosure Patterns of Opioid Use Disorders in Perinatal Care During the Opioid Epidemic on X From 2019 to 2021: Thematic Analysis.', 'Published': '2024-10-07', 'Copyright Information': '©Dezhi Wu, Minnie Ng, Saborny Sen Gupta, Phyllis Raynor, Youyou Tao, Yang Ren, Peiyin Hung, Shan Qiao, Jiajia Zhang, Jennifer Fillo, Xiaoming Li, Constance Guille, Kacey Eichelberger, Bankole Olatosi.

It also remains unclear to what extent severity of infection and psychiatric conditions, which are often linked to chronic fatigue, modify the risk of post-COVID-19 condition fatigue symptoms.\\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on self-reported fatigue and postexertional malaise over time and to explore possible risk factors, such as the impact of acute SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization and preexisting psychiatric conditions on postacute fatigue.\\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study, Danish residents aged 15 years and older were invited to participate in the EFTER-COVID survey, which used repeated, self-reported online questionnaires that collected information on fatigue (Fatigue Assessment Scale) and postexertional malaise scores (DePaul Symptom Questionnaire) after individuals' index SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test. Participants were included if they completed a baseline and at least 1 follow-up questionnaire 2 to 18 months after testing for SARS-CoV-2.\\nEXPOSURE: Testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection.\\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were fatigue and postexertional malaise 2 to 18 months after testing. Mixed-effects models were used to compare scores between SARS-CoV-2 test-positive and test-negative individuals (testing period April 2021 to February 2023).\\nRESULTS: Of a total of 50\\u202f115 participants (median [IQR] age at test date, 57 [46-67] years; 29\\u202f774 female [59.4%]), 25\\u202f249 were test positive and\\u200924\\u202f866 were test negative.

In the period 2 to 18 months after testing, SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a small but significant 3% increase in self-reported fatigue scores (score ratio [SR], 1.03; 95% CI, 1.03-1.04) and higher odds of self-reported postexertional malaise (odds ratio, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.81-2.30), compared with test-negative participants. In the same period, hospitalization with SARS-CoV-2 increased fatigue scores by 23% (SR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.20-1.26) compared with test-negative participants. Preexisting psychiatric conditions did not significantly modify postacute fatigue scores.\\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a subtle increase in self-reported fatigue and postexertional malaise symptoms 2 to 18 months after mild infection. In contrast, individuals hospitalized with acute SARS-CoV-2 experienced a more substantial increase in postacute symptoms. Preexisting psychiatric conditions did not significantly modify the risk of postacute fatigue symptoms.

Increased concerns about the impacts of escalating harmful opioid use among pregnant and postpartum persons are rising. Most of the current limited perinatal OUD studies were conducted using traditional methods, such as interviews and randomized controlled trials to understand OUD treatment, risk factors, and associated adverse effects. However, little is known about how social media data, such as X, formerly known as Twitter, can be leveraged to explore and identify broad perinatal OUD trends, disclosure and communication patterns, and public health surveillance about OUD in the perinatal period.\\nOBJECTIVE: The objective is 3-fold: first, we aim to identify key themes and trends in perinatal OUD discussions on platform X. Second, we explore user engagement patterns, including replying and retweeting behaviors. Third, we investigate computational methods that could potentially streamline and scale the labor-intensive manual annotation effort.\\nMETHODS: We extracted 6 million raw perinatal-themed tweets posted by global X users during the opioid epidemic from May 2019 to October 2021. After data cleaning and sampling, we used 500 tweets related to OUD in the perinatal period by US X users for a thematic analysis using NVivo (Lumivero) software.\\nRESULTS: Seven major themes emerged from our thematic analysis: (1) political views related to harmful opioid and other substance use, (2) perceptions of others' substance use, (3) lived experiences of opioid and other substance use, (4) news reports or papers related to opioid and other substance use, (5) health care initiatives, (6) adverse effects on children's health due to parental substance use, and (7) topics related to nonopioid substance use. Among these 7 themes, our user engagement analysis revealed that themes 4 and 5 received the highest average retweet counts, and theme 3 received the highest average tweet reply count. We further found that different computational methods excel in analyzing different themes.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Social media platforms such as X can serve as a valuable tool for analyzing real-time discourse and exploring public perceptions, opinions, and behaviors related to maternal substance use, particularly, harmful opioid use in the perinatal period. More health promotion strategies can be carried out on social media platforms to provide educational support for the OUD perinatal population.   \n",

The objectives of this pilot randomized controlled trial were to test the feasibility, user experience, and preliminary effect of using CCAs with adolescents in primary care, focusing on behavior change and collaborative goal setting among adolescents. From March 2019 to September 2022, adolescents were recruited from the Northeast Community Health Centre (Edmonton, AB). Adolescents were randomized (1:1) to one of two groups: CCA + goal setting (experimental group) or goal setting alone (control group). Data were collected from both groups at baseline and at 3-weeks post-baseline. In total, 31 adolescents completed the trial (terminated early due to COVID-19). The study demonstrated high practicality. Adolescents reported positive user experiences with CCAs, citing attractiveness, clarity, efficiency, and dependability. No group differences were detected for behavior changes at 3-weeks post-baseline ( > .05), although adolescents in the experimental group qualitatively described improved rapport and communication with HCPs. CCAs can be used practically in a primary health care setting to facilitate communication and rapport with adolescents; however, their effect in enabling behavior change should be investigated in a multi-site, larger-scale trial.   \n",
       "2  IMPORTANCE: Fatigue remains one of the most common and debilitating symptoms of post-COVID-19 condition; however, existing studies are limited to select populations and often lack noninfected controls. It also remains unclear to what extent severity of infection and psychiatric conditions, which are often linked to chronic fatigue, modify the risk of post-COVID-19 condition fatigue symptoms.\\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on self-reported fatigue and postexertional malaise over time and to explore possible risk factors, such as the impact of acute SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization and preexisting psychiatric conditions on postacute fatigue.\\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study, Danish residents aged 15 years and older were invited to participate in the EFTER-COVID survey, which used repeated, self-reported online questionnaires that collected information on fatigue (Fatigue Assessment Scale) and postexertional malaise scores (DePaul Symptom Questionnaire) after individuals' index SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test. Participants were included if they completed a baseline and at least 1 follow-up questionnaire 2 to 18 months after testing for SARS-CoV-2.\\nEXPOSURE: Testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection.\\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were fatigue and postexertional malaise 2 to 18 months after testing. Mixed-effects models were used to compare scores between SARS-CoV-2 test-positive and test-negative individuals (testing period April 2021 to February 2023).\\nRESULTS: Of a total of 50 115 participants (median [IQR] age at test date, 57 [46-67] years; 29 774 female [59.4%]), 25 249 were test positive and 24 866 were test negative. Most participants were vaccinated with at least 2 doses (21 164 test-negative participants [85.1%] and 22 120 test-positive participants [87.6%]) before their SARS-CoV-2 index test and fatigue reporting. In the period 2 to 18 months after testing, SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a small but significant 3% increase in self-reported fatigue scores (score ratio [SR], 1.03; 95% CI, 1.03-1.04) and higher odds of self-reported postexertional malaise (odds ratio, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.81-2.30), compared with test-negative participants. In the same period, hospitalization with SARS-CoV-2 increased fatigue scores by 23% (SR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.20-1.26) compared with test-negative participants. Preexisting psychiatric conditions did not significantly modify postacute fatigue scores.\\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a subtle increase in self-reported fatigue and postexertional malaise symptoms 2 to 18 months after mild infection. In contrast, individuals hospitalized with acute SARS-CoV-2 experienced a more substantial increase in postacute symptoms. Preexisting psychiatric conditions did not significantly modify the risk of postacute fatigue symptoms. The findings largely captured symptoms following first-time infections in a population where most had been vaccinated. Persons who experienced severe acute infection may benefit from clinical follow-up for fatigue.   \n",

       "      <td>BACKGROUND: In 2021, the United States experienced a 14% rise in fatal drug overdoses totaling 106,699 deaths, driven by harmful opioid use, particularly among individuals in the perinatal period who face increased risks associated with opioid use disorders (OUDs). Increased concerns about the impacts of escalating harmful opioid use among pregnant and postpartum persons are rising. Most of the current limited perinatal OUD studies were conducted using traditional methods, such as interviews and randomized controlled trials to understand OUD treatment, risk factors, and associated adverse effects. However, little is known about how social media data, such as X, formerly known as Twitter, can be leveraged to explore and identify broad perinatal OUD trends, disclosure and communication patterns, and public health surveillance about OUD in the perinatal period.\\nOBJECTIVE: The objective is 3-fold: first, we aim to identify key themes and trends in perinatal OUD discussions on platform X. Second, we explore user engagement patterns, including replying and retweeting behaviors. Third, we investigate computational methods that could potentially streamline and scale the labor-intensive manual annotation effort.\\nMETHODS: We extracted 6 million raw perinatal-themed tweets posted by global X users during the opioid epidemic from May 2019 to October 2021. After data cleaning and sampling, we used 500 tweets related to OUD in the perinatal period by US X users for a thematic analysis using NVivo (Lumivero) software.\\nRESULTS: Seven major themes emerged from our thematic analysis: (1) political views related to harmful opioid and other substance use, (2) perceptions of others' substance use, (3) lived experiences of opioid and other substance use, (4) news reports or papers related to opioid and other substance use, (5) health care initiatives, (6) adverse effects on children's health due to parental substance use, and (7) topics related to nonopioid substance use. Among these 7 themes, our user engagement analysis revealed that themes 4 and 5 received the highest average retweet counts, and theme 3 received the highest average tweet reply count. We further found that different computational methods excel in analyzing different themes.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Social media platforms such as X can serve as a valuable tool for analyzing real-time discourse and exploring public perceptions, opinions, and behaviors related to maternal substance use, particularly, harmful opioid use in the perinatal period. More health promotion strategies can be carried out on social media platforms to provide educational support for the OUD perinatal population.</td>\n",

       "      <td>['Conversation Cards for Adolescents©', 'p']\\nOur team developed  (CCAs), a tool to help adolescents and health care providers (HCPs) communicate and collaboratively set behavior change goals. The objectives of this pilot randomized controlled trial were to test the feasibility, user experience, and preliminary effect of using CCAs with adolescents in primary care, focusing on behavior change and collaborative goal setting among adolescents. From March 2019 to September 2022, adolescents were recruited from the Northeast Community Health Centre (Edmonton, AB). Adolescents were randomized (1:1) to one of two groups: CCA + goal setting (experimental group) or goal setting alone (control group). Data were collected from both groups at baseline and at 3-weeks post-baseline. In total, 31 adolescents completed the trial (terminated early due to COVID-19). The study demonstrated high practicality. Adolescents reported positive user experiences with CCAs, citing attractiveness, clarity, efficiency, and dependability. No group differences were detected for behavior changes at 3-weeks post-baseline ( &gt; .05), although adolescents in the experimental group qualitatively described improved rapport and communication with HCPs. CCAs can be used practically in a primary health care setting to facilitate communication and rapport with adolescents; however, their effect in enabling behavior change should be investigated in a multi-site, larger-scale trial.</td>\n",

       "      <td>Post-COVID-19 Condition Fatigue Outcomes Among Danish Residents.</td>\n",
       "      <td>IMPORTANCE: Fatigue remains one of the most common and debilitating symptoms of post-COVID-19 condition; however, existing studies are limited to select populations and often lack noninfected controls. It also remains unclear to what extent severity of infection and psychiatric conditions, which are often linked to chronic fatigue, modify the risk of post-COVID-19 condition fatigue symptoms.\\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on self-reported fatigue and postexertional malaise over time and to explore possible risk factors, such as the impact of acute SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization and preexisting psychiatric conditions on postacute fatigue.\\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study, Danish residents aged 15 years and older were invited to participate in the EFTER-COVID survey, which used repeated, self-reported online questionnaires that collected information on fatigue (Fatigue Assessment Scale) and postexertional malaise scores (DePaul Symptom Questionnaire) after individuals' index SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test. Participants were included if they completed a baseline and at least 1 follow-up questionnaire 2 to 18 months after testing for SARS-CoV-2.\\nEXPOSURE: Testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection.\\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were fatigue and postexertional malaise 2 to 18 months after testing. Mixed-effects models were used to compare scores between SARS-CoV-2 test-positive and test-negative individuals (testing period April 2021 to February 2023).\\nRESULTS: Of a total of 50 115 participants (median [IQR] age at test date, 57 [46-67] years; 29 774 female [59.4%]), 25 249 were test positive and 24 866 were test negative. Most participants were vaccinated with at least 2 doses (21 164 test-negative participants [85.1%] and 22 120 test-positive participants [87.6%]) before their SARS-CoV-2 index test and fatigue reporting. In the period 2 to 18 months after testing, SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a small but significant 3% increase in self-reported fatigue scores (score ratio [SR], 1.03; 95% CI, 1.03-1.04) and higher odds of self-reported postexertional malaise (odds ratio, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.81-2.30), compared with test-negative participants. In the same period, hospitalization with SARS-CoV-2 increased fatigue scores by 23% (SR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.20-1.26) compared with test-negative participants. Preexisting psychiatric conditions did not significantly modify postacute fatigue scores.\\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a subtle increase in self-reported fatigue and postexertional malaise symptoms 2 to 18 months after mild infection. In contrast, individuals hospitalized with acute SARS-CoV-2 experienced a more substantial increase in postacute symptoms. Preexisting psychiatric conditions did not significantly modify the risk of postacute fatigue symptoms. The findings largely captured symptoms following first-time infections in a population where most had been vaccinated. Persons who experienced severe acute infection may benefit from clinical follow-up for fatigue.</td>\n",

Increased concerns about the impacts of escalating harmful opioid use among pregnant and postpartum persons are rising. Most of the current limited perinatal OUD studies were conducted using traditional methods, such as interviews and randomized controlled trials to understand OUD treatment, risk factors, and associated adverse effects. However, little is known about how social media data, such as X, formerly known as Twitter, can be leveraged to explore and identify broad perinatal OUD trends, disclosure and communication patterns, and public health surveillance about OUD in the perinatal period.\\nOBJECTIVE: The objective is 3-fold: first, we aim to identify key themes and trends in perinatal OUD discussions on platform X. Second, we explore user engagement patterns, including replying and retweeting behaviors. Third, we investigate computational methods that could potentially streamline and scale the labor-intensive manual annotation effort.\\nMETHODS: We extracted 6 million raw perinatal-themed tweets posted by global X users during the opioid epidemic from May 2019 to October 2021. After data cleaning and sampling, we used 500 tweets related to OUD in the perinatal period by US X users for a thematic analysis using NVivo (Lumivero) software.\\nRESULTS: Seven major themes emerged from our thematic analysis: (1) political views related to harmful opioid and other substance use, (2) perceptions of others' substance use, (3) lived experiences of opioid and other substance use, (4) news reports or papers related to opioid and other substance use, (5) health care initiatives, (6) adverse effects on children's health due to parental substance use, and (7) topics related to nonopioid substance use. Among these 7 themes, our user engagement analysis revealed that themes 4 and 5 received the highest average retweet counts, and theme 3 received the highest average tweet reply count. We further found that different computational methods excel in analyzing different themes.\\nCONCLUSIONS: Social media platforms such as X can serve as a valuable tool for analyzing real-time discourse and exploring public perceptions, opinions, and behaviors related to maternal substance use, particularly, harmful opioid use in the perinatal period. More health promotion strategies can be carried out on social media platforms to provide educational support for the OUD perinatal population.   \n",

The objectives of this pilot randomized controlled trial were to test the feasibility, user experience, and preliminary effect of using CCAs with adolescents in primary care, focusing on behavior change and collaborative goal setting among adolescents. From March 2019 to September 2022, adolescents were recruited from the Northeast Community Health Centre (Edmonton, AB). Adolescents were randomized (1:1) to one of two groups: CCA + goal setting (experimental group) or goal setting alone (control group). Data were collected from both groups at baseline and at 3-weeks post-baseline. In total, 31 adolescents completed the trial (terminated early due to COVID-19). The study demonstrated high practicality. Adolescents reported positive user experiences with CCAs, citing attractiveness, clarity, efficiency, and dependability. No group differences were detected for behavior changes at 3-weeks post-baseline ( > .05), although adolescents in the experimental group qualitatively described improved rapport and communication with HCPs. CCAs can be used practically in a primary health care setting to facilitate communication and rapport with adolescents; however, their effect in enabling behavior change should be investigated in a multi-site, larger-scale trial.   \n",
       "2  IMPORTANCE: Fatigue remains one of the most common and debilitating symptoms of post-COVID-19 condition; however, existing studies are limited to select populations and often lack noninfected controls. It also remains unclear to what extent severity of infection and psychiatric conditions, which are often linked to chronic fatigue, modify the risk of post-COVID-19 condition fatigue symptoms.\\nOBJECTIVE: To evaluate the impact of SARS-CoV-2 infection on self-reported fatigue and postexertional malaise over time and to explore possible risk factors, such as the impact of acute SARS-CoV-2 hospitalization and preexisting psychiatric conditions on postacute fatigue.\\nDESIGN, SETTING, AND PARTICIPANTS: In this cohort study, Danish residents aged 15 years and older were invited to participate in the EFTER-COVID survey, which used repeated, self-reported online questionnaires that collected information on fatigue (Fatigue Assessment Scale) and postexertional malaise scores (DePaul Symptom Questionnaire) after individuals' index SARS-CoV-2 polymerase chain reaction test. Participants were included if they completed a baseline and at least 1 follow-up questionnaire 2 to 18 months after testing for SARS-CoV-2.\\nEXPOSURE: Testing for SARS-CoV-2 infection.\\nMAIN OUTCOMES AND MEASURES: The primary outcomes were fatigue and postexertional malaise 2 to 18 months after testing. Mixed-effects models were used to compare scores between SARS-CoV-2 test-positive and test-negative individuals (testing period April 2021 to February 2023).\\nRESULTS: Of a total of 50 115 participants (median [IQR] age at test date, 57 [46-67] years; 29 774 female [59.4%]), 25 249 were test positive and 24 866 were test negative. Most participants were vaccinated with at least 2 doses (21 164 test-negative participants [85.1%] and 22 120 test-positive participants [87.6%]) before their SARS-CoV-2 index test and fatigue reporting. In the period 2 to 18 months after testing, SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a small but significant 3% increase in self-reported fatigue scores (score ratio [SR], 1.03; 95% CI, 1.03-1.04) and higher odds of self-reported postexertional malaise (odds ratio, 2.04; 95% CI, 1.81-2.30), compared with test-negative participants. In the same period, hospitalization with SARS-CoV-2 increased fatigue scores by 23% (SR, 1.23; 95% CI, 1.20-1.26) compared with test-negative participants. Preexisting psychiatric conditions did not significantly modify postacute fatigue scores.\\nCONCLUSIONS AND RELEVANCE: In this cohort study, SARS-CoV-2 infection was associated with a subtle increase in self-reported fatigue and postexertional malaise symptoms 2 to 18 months after mild infection. In contrast, individuals hospitalized with acute SARS-CoV-2 experienced a more substantial increase in postacute symptoms. Preexisting psychiatric conditions did not significantly modify the risk of postacute fatigue symptoms. The findings largely captured symptoms following first-time infections in a population where most had been vaccinated. Persons who experienced severe acute infection may benefit from clinical follow-up for fatigue.   \n",
